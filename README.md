## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (version 16 or higher)
-   npm or yarn package manager
-   A Google Gemini API key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kaunghtut24/Gemini_Advanced_Chat.git
    cd Gemini_Advanced_Chat
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your API key:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```
    **Important:** The variable name must be `VITE_API_KEY` (not `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `API_KEY`) for Vite to recognize it.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Open in your browser:**
    -   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`
    -   You can now start chatting with the Gemini model!

### Building for Production

1.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2.  **Preview the production build:**
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `VITE_API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API key (required)

### Supported Models

The application is configured to use `gemini-2.5-flash` by default, which provides the best balance of speed and capability.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File Upload Errors:** Ensure you're uploading supported file formats. The application will show a warning for unsupported files.

2. **API Key Issues:** 
   - Make sure your API key is correctly set in the `.env.local` file
   - Verify the variable name is `VITE_API_KEY` (not `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `API_KEY`)
   - Restart the development server after changing environment variables
   - Check browser console for error messages like "An API Key must be set when running in a browser"
   - Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions from Google AI Studio

3. **React Warnings:** This version has been optimized to eliminate common React warnings like "setState during render" and "hooks order violations."

4. **Development Server Issues:** If you encounter CORS or loading issues, make sure to run `npm run dev` and access the app at `http://localhost:5173`
