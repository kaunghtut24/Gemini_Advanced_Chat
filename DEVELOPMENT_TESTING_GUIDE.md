# Development Testing Guide

## üß™ Web Search Testing in Development vs Production

### Current Status ‚úÖ

#### Tavily API
- **Development**: ‚úÖ Works perfectly (supports CORS)
- **Production**: ‚úÖ Works via Vercel proxy
- **Testing**: Full connectivity testing available

#### SerpAPI
- **Development**: ‚ö†Ô∏è CORS blocked (expected behavior)
- **Production**: ‚úÖ Works via Vercel proxy
- **Testing**: Gracefully skipped in development

#### Google Search (via Gemini)
- **Development**: ‚úÖ Works with Gemini API
- **Production**: ‚úÖ Works with Gemini API
- **Testing**: Always available

### Understanding the Behavior

#### Why SerpAPI Fails in Development
```
Access to fetch at 'https://serpapi.com/search?...' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

This is **expected** and **correct** behavior because:
1. SerpAPI doesn't allow direct browser calls (CORS policy)
2. We need a backend proxy to call SerpAPI
3. In production, our Vercel serverless functions act as this proxy
4. In development, we can't test the full SerpAPI flow without running Vercel locally

#### How We Handle This

1. **Development Testing**:
   - Tavily: Full testing ‚úÖ
   - SerpAPI: Graceful skip with informative message ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Gemini: Full testing ‚úÖ

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - All providers work via Vercel serverless functions
   - CORS issues are eliminated
   - Full functionality available

### Testing Commands

#### Option 1: Test with Current Setup (Recommended)
```bash
npm run dev
# Open Settings ‚Üí Web Search Providers
# Test Tavily: Will work with real API key
# Test SerpAPI: Will show helpful skip message
```

#### Option 2: Test with Vercel CLI (Full Production Simulation)
```bash
npm install -g vercel
npm run build
vercel dev
# Now all search providers will work exactly like production
```

#### Option 3: Production Testing
```bash
vercel --prod
# Test all providers in real production environment
```

### Expected Console Output

#### Development Mode
```
üß™ Testing tavily provider - Environment: Development
üîç Tavily search - Environment: Development, Endpoint: direct-api-tavily
‚úÖ tavily test successful

üß™ Testing serpapi provider - Environment: Development
‚ö†Ô∏è SerpAPI testing skipped in development due to CORS restrictions
‚úÖ SerpAPI will work in production via Vercel proxy
```

#### Production Mode
```
üß™ Testing serpapi provider - Environment: Production
üîç SerpAPI search - Environment: Production, Endpoint: /api/search/serpapi
‚úÖ serpapi test successful
```

### Developer Notes

1. **This is correct behavior** - SerpAPI blocking CORS is their security policy
2. **Our solution is proper** - Using serverless functions as CORS proxies
3. **Testing strategy is sound** - Skip what can't work, test what can
4. **Production will work** - All providers function in deployed environment

### Troubleshooting

#### If you see SerpAPI errors in development:
- ‚úÖ This is expected and normal
- ‚úÖ Check that the error message is CORS-related
- ‚úÖ Verify that Tavily testing works (proves our logic is correct)
- ‚úÖ Test in production or with `vercel dev` for full functionality

#### If you want to test SerpAPI in development:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Run with Vercel's development server
vercel dev

# Now test SerpAPI - it will work via the proxy
```

### Summary

Our implementation is **working correctly**:
- ‚úÖ Handles development limitations gracefully
- ‚úÖ Provides clear user feedback
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly in production
- ‚úÖ Follows web security best practices
- ‚úÖ Uses appropriate CORS workarounds

The "errors" you see are actually the system working as designed - protecting against CORS violations while ensuring production functionality.
